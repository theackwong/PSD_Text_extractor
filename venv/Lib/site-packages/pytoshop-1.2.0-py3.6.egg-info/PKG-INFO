        A Python-based library to read and write Photoshop PSD and PSB files.
        
        Based on the specification `from Adobe
        <https://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/>`__,
        but also with the help of the `psd-tools
        <https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools/>`__ source code.

        Features
        --------
        
        - Parsing of the most important tags.  This is not complete, but the
          infrastructure is in place to add support for more quite easily.
        
        - Loading of complex nested layer structures, and the ability to edit
          them and write them back out.

        History
        =======
        
        1.2.0 (2017-12-13) (2017-09-26)
        ------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fix #4: Change masked layer to same size as image layer when using
          the `user.nested_layers` interface.
        
        1.0.1 (2017-08-01) (2017-07-29)
        ------
        
        - Declared API as stable.
        
        0.6.0 (2017-07-24)
        ------
        
        Minor improvements:
        
        - Make it easier to choose the right channel, given the current color
          mode.
        
        0.5.0 (2017-07-03)
        ------
        
        Minor improvements:
        
        - The color assigned to a layer (displayed in the layer list) is now
          available in the ``nested_layers`` API.
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fix crash in ``GuideResourceBlock``.
        
        0.4.1 (2017-06-05)
        ------------------
        
        Minor improvements:
        
        - Parse multiple values in a struct together when possible.  This has
          a modest speed improvement.
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fix pip install [#1]
        
        - The main canvas image will use the specified compression algorithm
          when using nested_layers_to_psd.
        
        - Non-image layers correctly set "pixel_data_is_irrelevant" flag.
        
        0.4.0 (2017-05-12)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - For speed purposes, pytoshop no longer uses traitlets.
        
        - Performance improvements to the compression/decompression code.
        
        - Added support for the ``shmd`` metadata tagged block, and the ability
          to access it from the ``user.nested_layers`` API.
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Updated the list of tagged blocks that use 8-bit lengths.
        
        - Fixed a bug where the image data would be corrupted when writing
          images from an input file to an output file with a different file
          format version.
        
        - Fixed a crash when the input file contains no layer group ids.
        
        - Allow Numpy arrays of shape () in place of scalars for constant
          images.
        
        0.3.0 (2017-01-09)
        ------------------
        
        Improvements:
        
        - ``pytoshop`` now runs on Python 2.7, in addition to 3.4 and 3.5.
        
        - Many of the image resources types are now handled directly, rather
          than through a generic bytes-only interface.
        
        - Major speedups in compression codecs.
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Saving a layer with a constant color (in ``nested_layers_to_psd``)
          now works correctly.
        
        - Unicode string decoding now properly handles trailing zeroes.
        
        - The "name source" on layers (when created from
          ``nested_layers_to_psd``) would point to the wrong source, but is
          now fixed.
        
        - Fix a bug when writing a layer of width 1.
